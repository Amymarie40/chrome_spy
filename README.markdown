# ChromeSpy

A Ruby script to help report about your Google Chrome usage. Some examples of
questions you can answer:

* what have I search for recently?
* which sites do I visit most frequently?
* what urls do I type into the address bar frequently?
* what have I downloaded and how big are the files?
